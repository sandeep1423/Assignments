#4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators.
If we ask Python to print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.


# In[7]:


4*5+20-40 # Is an Expression, The Python Interpreter Evaluates it to 0

#5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

Ans: An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators.
    When we type an expression at the prompt, the interpreter evaluates it, 
    which means that it finds the value of the expression.

eg: 4*5+20-40 is an example of a statement

A statement is a unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable 
or displaying a value.When we type a statement, the interpreter executes it, 
which means that it does whatever the statement says. In general, statements donâ€™t have values.

eg: variable declaration and assignment are statements because they do not return a value


# In[8]:


4*5+20-40 # Is a Expression
courseName = 'INeuron FullStack DataScience' # Is a Statement
print("Hello World !") # Is a Expression Statement

''''6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1'''

#Ans 
    The variable bacon is set to 22 .The expression bacon + 1 does not 
    reassign the value in bacon (that would the case if the expression is like bacon = bacon + 1 instead of bacon + 1)


# In[10]:


# Example Case#1
bacon=22
bacon+1
print(bacon)


# In[9]:

    string version of the value passed to them.


# In[13]:


int(15.52)


# In[14]:


float(18)


# In[15]:


str(122)

'I have eaten ' + 99 + 'burritos.'


# In[ ]:


ANS:
    since 99 is not string so need tp typecast to int to str
